Event Format
Our co-ed volleyball events are structured to ensure balanced and fair play. Teams are pre-assigned based on player skill levels. Play time is 2 ½ hours and each team plays two games then is required to ref one game.
Teams: 6 players per team
Balance: We ensure that each team is evenly matched to promote competitive yet enjoyable gameplay.
Game Rules: Matches are played to 18 points.
Skill Requirements
Our co-ed events are intended for experienced players. You should be comfortable with the following skills:
Passing and hitting with consistent accuracy and power.
Solid understanding of rotations (5-1 & 6-2).
Ability to demonstrate proper blocking and ball placement.
These skill requirements are in place to maintain a competitive environment and ensure all participants can fully enjoy the event.
Registration and Fees
$12 per player with yearly insurance already purchased.
$15.50 per player for those without insurance, which includes a one-time annual insurance fee to cover liability at Girls Inc. of New Hampshire.
Payments must be made within 24 hours of sign-up to confirm your spot, and a $5 late fee will apply for any payments made after the deadline.
Prizes and Extras
To add some extra excitement, we offer a prize system that rewards outstanding performances. Players can accumulate points through our Plinko Game based on their gameplay, and redeem them for cool prizes like backpacks, hoodies, pro volleyballs, and more</p>
